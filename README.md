# Cyber-Security-Threats-Frameworks

Welcome to my Cyber Security Threats & Frameworks Repository! This repository contains my assignment for the Cyber Security Threats module of University of York.

# Requirements of this Assignment
The York Satellite Navigation Company (YSNC) is a fictional commercial satellite
company who are planning to operate a number of Low Earth orbit (LEO) navigation
satellites to provide an alternative to existing satellite services like the Global
Positioning System (GPS) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The
service being proposed by the company is “Providing a reliable satellite navigation
service”.

The required satellites have been successfully launched into orbit, and the company
is preparing a Risk Management Plan prior to launching the new service. This
involves assessing potential risks, threats, and weaknesses in the Ground Based
systems, the Communications systems, and the Satellites.

You have been asked to produce a cyber security risk management plan for the
service for the company board of directors, and to comment on any additional issues
and technical areas relating to cyber security, which may need further consideration
or research activity to allow the service to succeed and develop.

**Section A**
A structured risk assessment and management plan conforming to an appropriate
recognised industry standard or methodology. You must state which standard or
methodology you have applied and why, by giving examples of how you have applied
it at each stage. You must also clearly state any assumptions you have made about
the proposed service or the outcomes from the scenario information provided.

**Section B** 
A threat analysis related to two identified security issues that you believe may affect the service, along with recommendations for how to resolve those issues.

**Section C**
A description of any legal, ethical and technical issues, including those from recent or current research, relating to cyber security that you recommend that the company management should consider for further work or inclusion in the service, along with an explanation of why you believe these areas merit such consideration.
